# Bioinformatics Analysis of Unidentifind Meat Samples 
## Project overview 
### This project analyses DNA sequences from unknown meat samples found at heathrow Airport to determine their original species.The analysis includes sequence reformatting, reference sequences identification,DNA to amino acid translation,and phylogentic tree construction.The results provide reliable species identification,supporting public health and food safety.
## Key features
## Repository structure
 ### python_work(folder)
* ###### bioinformatics_assignment script (used for amino acid converstion using ORF)
* ###### amino_translated_without_ORF file (contains amino acids translated using only geneticcode table2 without ORF).
* ###### translated_amino_acids file (contains the final amino acide translated sequences used for phyogenetic tree construction)
* ###### all_sequences_combined file (contains all DNA sequences include the references) 
* ### samples_sequences(folder)
* ###### reformate.sh (bash script used to merage and convert the sequences to fasta types)
* ###### Sample*.FASTQ (FASTQ files contain the original sequences meraged )
* ###### sample*_full.fasta (Fasta files contain the DNA meraged sequences)
* ###### sample*.fasta (files contain the sequences divided to three parts)
* ###### sample* part*(files contain all the original DNA sequences)
 contains the original sequences and the script used for fasta files convertion from FASTQ and the files fasta files after the sequences'sparts marages and sequnces converstions
